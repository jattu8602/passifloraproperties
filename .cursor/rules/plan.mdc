Book Your Vacation


Passiflora Wellness & Spa Resort
Wellness is not only a wonderful way of getting well-needed relaxation in your stress-filled everyday life, but it also replenishes the mind and soul to level your thoughts you might have lost long ago. Every emotion you feel relates to the well-being of the body, mind, and soul, so maintaining and nurturing it is an act of importance for a long, happy, and fulfilling life. In turn, our well-being directly affects our actions and emotions. It’s an ongoing circle.

Therefore, it’s important for everyone to achieve optimal wellness to subdue stress, reduce the risk of illness and ensure positive interactions. Wellness is an active process of becoming aware of and making choices toward a healthier and more fulfilling life. Wellness is more than being free from illness, it is a dynamic process of change and growth.
But how can wellness be achieved? What can our wellness retreats do to help you achieve that?



365 Days Pune Yoga & Ayurveda
“Yoga is part of Ayurveda… and Ayurveda is part of Yoga”
At the Passiflora Wellness Resorts, we created an atmosphere which is inspiring and calming, beautiful and unique. The adult-only peace and tranquility of the resort will very quickly change your moods and if you join one of our ongoing Pune Yoga Retreat Programs, you will be instantly connected to others. Dare to join, even if you have never tried, our classes are suitable for complete beginners, intermediate and advanced practitioners! Get into holiday mode, no matter if you join a program or not. The resort follows a mixed concept, offering Wellness, Ayurveda, and Yoga programs but at the same time, caters to “normal” holiday makers with an excellent choice of meals and wines. So, it’s completely up to you how you design your holiday retreat program.

We run AyurYoga Retreats, Ayurveda & Yoga, all year round.
Join one of the Passiflora Pune Yoga Retreats on any day of the year or organize your own retreat at the resort. If you are an organizer or just want to run your own program with a few friends, please send us a message here


“A Relaxing Experience”
Absolutely gorgeous resort and rooms. The owner and the staff are lovely. Good healthy food. Some really great yoga teachers. The Ayurveda Doctor was exceedingly kind to give my friend and I some advice on how to find better balance. It’s perfect if you are looking for a chill experience with some relaxed Yoga sessions daily.

“Best combination of pleasure and health”
I was there for a Wellness and Pune Yoga Retreat and enjoyed Yoga and Wellness every day. The Yoga was amazing as there are different Yoga teachers every morning and you can learn about the different styles, and which one works best for you. The Wellness team at the Spa is very professional and I experienced perfect massages in the beautiful resort. But the best thing in this resort in my opinion are the people there. You really feel that the staff from the resort as well as the yoga teachers want to make you happy and that they pay attention for your needs. This creates a nice and positive atmosphere.

Can I do Yoga?
Beginners Welcome
There are many kinds of yoga practices by daily changing teachers, so it is possible for anyone to start. Whether you’re a couch potato or an athlete, size and fitness levels do not matter because there are modifications for every yoga pose to fit beginners in every style. The idea is to explore your limits, not strive for perfection. It is a wonderful way to get in tune with your body and your inner self.”

Physical Benefits
The relaxation techniques incorporated in yoga can lessen chronic pain, such as lower back pain, headaches, arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Yoga can also reduce insomnia and lower blood pressure.
Other physical benefits of yoga include:
Increased flexibility
Increased muscle strength and tone
Maintaining a balanced metabolism
improved respiration, energy, and vitality
Cardio and circulatory health
Improved athletic performance
Weight reduction
Protection from injury

Mental Benefits
Aside from the physical benefits, one of the benefits of yoga is how it helps manage stress, which is known to have devastating effects on the body and mind. Stress can reveal itself in many ways, including sleeping problems, back or neck pain, headaches, drug abuse, and an inability to concentrate. Yoga can be highly effective in developing coping skills and reaching a more positive outlook on life.

Incorporation of meditation and breathing in Yoga can help improve mental well-being. Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness, increases body awareness, relaxes the mind, relieves chronic stress patterns, centres attention, and sharpens concentration. Body- and self-awareness are most beneficial because they can help with early detection of physical problems and allow for preventive action.

Passiflora Healthy Nutrition
Passiflora Ayur Yoga Programs and Wellness Escapes include daily meals that are tasty, whole, healthy and fresh. Every day, you’ll be enjoying great food served with Life-Drinks. For those wanting a la Carte, we also have a separate menu with Ayurvedic, Vegetarian and Vegan dishes.
Healthy Nutrition
Our chefs use the best and healthiest ingredients, ensuring you get great taste combined with freshness and health benefits. Eating at the local restaurants means an over-saturation of Sugar and MSG (monosodium glutamate), having highly addictive qualities that many fall victim to, being unaware about the dangers. At the PassifloraRestaurant, you can eat with peace, as we put you at the forefront.

You can enjoy your Satvik meals throughout the day, whether breakfast, lunch or dinner. Our sets are well balanced, delivering nutrition while still remaining light and tasty. If your goal is to lose weight, this is a healthy way of feeling light and fresh without feeling famished.



For Healthy Nutrition: Natural Green Hydroponics Vegetables
We purchase our vegetables from the best local hydroponic and organic farms, guaranteeing the best in quality. The premium we pay for organically grown vegetables is well worth the health benefits.

Rice Bran Cooking Oil
This is the ideal cooking oil for many Thai dishes, as these have a much higher smoke point than the normally used Palm Oil. Palm oil is used heavily due to its low price, yet it is also the least healthy option available. We don’t use it here, as your health is our priority.

Gourmet Olive Oil, Cold-Pressed
For our western cuisine, we use only the best cold-pressed olive oil, and the differences are obvious once you have a taste. We use olive oils imported from Spain for the best possible taste.

Organic Brown Jasmin Rice & Riceberry
We use AAA quality organic rice and riceberry in our dishes. We use only the best ingredients available in India. You won’t find this type of rice anywhere in Pune.

Your Own Cold Pressed Juicing Station
Compose your own breakfast juice the way you like it. Our new juice station spoils you with unlimited fresh compositions of vegetable and fruit juices, mixed to your taste. Our commercial cold press juicing machine preserves vitamins and taste and you can close the lid and mix each juice to your taste.
What are the benefits of a cold pressed juicer?
Most juicing processes involve centrifugal juicers that generate a lot of heat while spinning, losing a considerable amount of nutrients. Therefore, cold-pressed juices make for a healthier alternative by providing all the lacking nutrients to our bodies, and help make conditions like anemia, PCOS or diabetes better

A practical juice menu is provided, in case you are not sure how to get tasty and healthy juices every morning.

Do you like the taste of it?
Have a look at our new Juicing and Raw Food Retreat!


PassifloraVegetables and Fruits from Organic Planet Farm
For a truly nourishing diet, we proudly provide only the finest quality, certified organic vegetables and fruits. Organic Planet, founded in 2022, stands as one of our premier suppliers of wholesome nutrition. Nestled to the north of Pune in the picturesque Phangna Province, the farm delivers our delectable produce twice a week. Relish the unparalleled taste and freshness in your meals and elevate your mornings with a super drink, crafted using our Kuvings Cold Press Juice Machines. Healthy Nutrition is priority at PassifloraAyurveda Resort.

In 2025, we also embarked on cultivating our own farm, gradually enriching our selection with fresh, delectable vegetables from our very own harvest.





The Adult Only, Family Owned Boutique Resort is Unique in its style and location
Passiflora Resort Villas
Passiflora Ayur Yoga Programs and Wellness Escapes include daily meals that are tasty, whole, healthy and fresh. Every day, you’ll be enjoying great food served with Life-Drinks. For those wanting a la Carte, we also have a separate menu with Ayurvedic, Vegetarian and Vegan dishes.

SIMPLY CALLING IT A “HOTEL ROOM” WOULD BE AN INSULT TO THESE LUXURY VILLA’S IN PUNE’S UNIQUE AYURVEDA SPA RESORT
At the Passiflora Wellness Resorts we don’t just offer you a hotel room – we have created your own home away from home, hardly comparable with what is known as standard hotel accommodation. With great attention to detail, we have created unique villas, which are functional, as well as beautiful. Using mostly natural materials, such as teak wood and terracotta, local tropical style and authentic feel have been preserved.
The Interior Design has been created by Australian artist John Underwood who is known for his wealth of experience in designing hotels and resorts, such as The J.W. Marriott in Pune, various Four Season Resorts and the Anantara in Chiang  Rai. The Villas have been designed to be “naturally cool”, with very effective insulation and air ventilation through the roof. We can guarantee you that you will feel comfortable and relaxed when staying here – so don’t hesitate – book your stay now or browse through more pictures of the resort here.



The Passiflora Restaurant & Wine Cellar
AUTHENTIC HOME-STYLE THAI CUISINE & MEDITERRANEAN DELIGHTS WITH ASIAN HERBS AND SPICES – ORGANIC, FRESH AND HEALTHY!
The Restaurant with its open show-kitchen and wine cellar offers a la carte Mediterranean delights with Asian tastes in a refreshing open-air setting. For classic Home-Style Thai Cuisine, we will present you a separate menu, which among other includes many famous Thai dishes.

Everything is freshly prepared, which means it does sometimes take a bit longer. We welcome special requests, so if you are looking for something not currently on the menu, please let us know. The restaurant features interesting theme nights, such as the Thai Food Lovers Night, the 5 Gems of Asia and various changing activities.

The cozy underground Wine Cellaris a unique feature in Pune. Take two flights of stairs downwards, and guests have the feeling to have been taken to the Bordeaux region.
Private dinner arrangements are offered for your anniversary, birthday or any other special occasion.

Activities available in our Resort
THAI COOKING CLASSES – ANIMAL TOWEL FOLDING FUN – MORNING YOGA….. AND MUCH MORE!
As a relatively small Boutique Resort, we would like to encourage our guests to participate, to connect with each other. Many large hotels are different, not delivering the personal experience they should. It’s like living in a high rise apartment block, where people don’t even know their neighbors. In a smaller resort, the chance that guests connect to each other and to our team is much higher and we wish to encourage this, by putting on weekly activities, just for adding to the fun experience.

THAI COOKING CLASSES
Thai food is famous around the World and with Asia shops mushrooming in almost every country and city worldwide, more and more people like to cook some of the tasteful and spicy dishes at home. Book a Thai Cooking Class with our Chefs and learn by doing. Cooking is truly passion for our Master Chef’, Mr. Rod, so be prepared for cooking lessons from the heart that truly will satisfy your belly and eyes.

MORNING YOGA SESSIONS
Daily morning Yoga with different teachers at our beautiful all-teak Prana Yoga Sala. Different, highly qualified teachers, different Yoga styles – all year round! Guests can join, even without booking a retreat program.

HAPPY & HEALTHY HOURS
From 3 pm to 6.30 pm every day, enjoy a large choice of healthy drinks at reduced price, es well as cocktails, beer and wine. It’s the time when everyone mingles around the pool bar, connecting and exchanging experiences. We are happy people, which is why we think one hour wouldn’t be enough.
