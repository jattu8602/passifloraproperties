        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          For over two decades, Passiflora Properties has redefined what it means to invest in land.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          We believe that every piece of land carries a story — of roots, growth, and legacy. Our purpose
          is to help people not just buy land, but own a meaningful part of nature that grows in both value
          and emotion over time.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          Founded with a vision to combine luxury, transparency, and sustainability, Passiflora Properties
          has become one of India’s most trusted names in farm plots, second homes, villas, and resort
          developments. From the calm valleys of Rajgad and Pawna to the emerging real estate corridors of
          Bihar and Jharkhand, our projects are designed to balance peaceful living with profitable growth.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          At Passiflora, we go beyond transactions — we build lifelong relationships. Every investor, every
          family, every dream matters to us. Whether you’re looking for a serene weekend home, a farmland
          that earns returns, or a long-term legacy for your next generation — we stand with you at every
          step.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          We handle your property as our own — ensuring legal transparency, consistent appreciation, and even
          managed cultivation through our FPO partnership model, where your land works for you.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
          Because when you invest with Passiflora, you don’t just buy land — you plant your legacy.
